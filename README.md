This program was configured to run on startup on a Raspberry Pi, to be displayed on the Yale Becton LCD. Although it will run on any system, the art is specialized for that particular system, so it will not have the same effect. 

For this art display, I was inspired by videos and pictures of ant trails, who often walk erratically for a short time, using visual cues and their amazing memories to decide which direction they need to go in, either to find food or go home. After they’ve determined their direction, they will walk in a straight line, until they again walk erratically to ensure they’re on the right course and correct it if need be.
